# UC Berkeley's Course CS188: Into to AI

## Repository Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the course projects from [_the course website_](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

**Search**:

Implementation of depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search and A* search algorithms with heuristics. These algorithms are used for finding the paths Pacman should follow in it's world. [_project description link_](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)

**Multiagent**:

Implementation of one and then multiagent ecosystem; using minimax, alpha-beta pruning and expectimax algorithms. Evaluation functions are also implemented by me. These algorithms are used to earn the best score in Pacman's world with different number of gosts. [_project description link_](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)

**Reinforcement Learning**:

Implementation of value iteration and Q learning; policies, epsilon greedy and approximate Q-learning as well. [_project description link_](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)

**Ghostbusters**:

Implementation of Exact Inference and Approximate Inferece.
_According to project's scenerio, pacman develops a talent and it is now able to sense/hear the ghosts but this also becomes its curse, he cannot see anymore..._ [_project description link_](http://ai.berkeley.edu/tracking.html)
